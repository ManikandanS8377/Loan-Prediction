Here I am using two data sets which are train and test data set.Two algorithms are used to build the model such as Logistic regression and Random forest. Here logistic_regression.ipynp and random forest.ipynp file my working files which is hepl you to understand the analyzing and model building part where as model_final.ipynp file helps to deploy the project.Inside the templates folder index.html file is there ,it is a font-end page for deployment. And finalmodel2.pkl file is used to pickling the model and samplesubmission.csv file is used to store the prediction output of the model.
